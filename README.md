### The talk will focus on reproducible interactive computing using Python:

* IPython interpreter (REPL)
* Ipython notebook (Brower based)
* Setting up a cloud notebook (Web based)
* Some files for the Python meetup tommorow at 

### Some usefull links
* Download a complete production ready python stack from the [downloads](http://www.insightstack.co.za/downloads) page. This is very usefull. No broblems installing Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas etc.
* Point your browsers to the [following url](http://95.85.29.190:8999/notebooks/python_meetup.ipynb) during the talk and play with. [I will start it up sometime tonight, and give you the password tommorow]
* Have a look at this [Github repo](http://tooblippe.github.io/zapycon2013_ipython_science/). Most of it is in there.
* Here is a static view of the [Notebook](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/output/pycon13_ipython.html)
* Link to the converted workbook as a [Reveal.js](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/output/pycon13_ipython.slides.html#/) presentation.
* Example of this workbook [converted to PDF](https://github.com/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/output/pycon13_ipython_complete.pdf?raw=true) and a page or two added automatically. This completed the whole cycle from:

<pre>REPL to  Explore to Notebook to Share to Present to Publish</pre>

 

### IPython console to play with
If you do not feel like installing anything find an online IPython console [HERE](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/try-ipython/)


cheers, see you tommorow.
